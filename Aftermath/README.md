# Aftermath

This is a distribution of https://github.com/jamf/aftermath

The original distribution is built as PKG file, and therefore can not be directly invoked by an automated process without first installing or unpacking.

This means that we are leveraging the `aftermath` binary directly when using in conjunction with Velociraptor
